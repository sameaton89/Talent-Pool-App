# Talent Pool

### Introduction
Talent Pool is a real estate and social app that allows the user to compare the average American salary against the average rent in a given zip code. Simply enter a zip code, choose the desired size of your apartment, and our app ranks the cost effectieness on a scale of one to five. Users may browse anonymously or register an account, allowing them to save search results and connect with other users.

### Motivation
We built Talent Pool for people like us: young, on a budget, and facing the double bind of modern urban living. Although millennials increasingly choose city living over the suburbs, wages aren't rising commensurately with the soaring cost of rent. Talent Pool allows the user to enjoy the excitement of city living while maximizing earnings. Why not have it both ways?
